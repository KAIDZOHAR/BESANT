#STEP 1 MAKE A 2D LIST IN WHICH EACH ENTRY HAS AN ARRIVAL TIME AND A DEPARTURE TIME OR MAKE 2 SEPARATE LIST
D = [[9.00, 9.45],
     [9.20, 9.55],
     [9.40, 9.58],
     [9.50, 10.40],
     [10.10, 10.55],
     [11.10, 11.25],
     [11.25, 11.30],
     [11.45, 12.45],
     [12.10, 13.05],
     [12.59, 13.10],
     [13.13, 14.30]]
#STEP 2 TAKE INPUT TIME FROM USER ,STORE IT IN A VARIABLE T
T = float(input('ENTER TIME '))
#STEP 3 TAKE VALUES OF ARRIVAL TIME AND CORRESPONDING DEPARTURE TIME FROM THE LIST

tracks = 0
for i in range(0, len(D)):
    
    time_row = D[i]
    Arr_Time = time_row[0]
    Dep_Time = time_row[1]


#STEP 4 WRITE THE LOGIC 
    if (T < Dep_Time) and (T  > Arr_Time):
        tracks +=1
        
print(tracks)



#KEY LESSONS

#1 MAKE SURE YOUR LIST IS APPROPRIATE ENOUGH TO RUN THE SAME CODE AGAIN AND AGAIN CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE IN THE INITIAL LIST AND THIS ONE

#2 INPUT IS ALWAYS A STRING MAKE SURE U TYPECAST IT APPROPRIATELY TO AVOID COMPARING IT WITH A DIFFERENT DATA TYPE(T < DEP TIME)
        
#3 RANGE IS ALWAYS 2 INTEGERS IF U EVER GET CONFUSED TRY len()

#4 D[i] IS THE iTH ROW. IN A LOOP IT WILL TAKE VALUES D[0], D[1], D[2] ETC.

#5 HOW TO USE A COUNTER. U NEED 3 STATEMENTS 1.INITIALISE COUNTER BEFORE FOR LOOP 2. WRITE UPDATE STATEMENT(i+=1) INSIDE FOR LOOP. 3.WRITE PRINT STATEMENT INSIDE THE LOOP IF U WANT TO PRINT MULTIPLE TIMES. WRITE OUTSIDE THE LOOP IF U WANT TO PRINT FINAL VALUE
